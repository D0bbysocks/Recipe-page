### What I learned

This was the first exercise where I really had to puzzle things out to make it look exactly like the mobile design. Getting the bullet points centered correctly when the text wrapped onto a new line - without the text flowing around them - was pretty tricky but also a lot of fun. I ended up finding three different solutions for it. I’m still not sure if I might have over-engineered it a bit and if there’s actually a simpler way to achieve the same result.
